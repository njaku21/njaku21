- 👋 Hi, I’m @njaku21
- 👀 I’m interested in technology and the process itself of building and fixing things and expanding my understanding of how things work and function together, both in the world we live in. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang in my fre time. I've got some good foundational experience with Python and Powershell, building small extensions and applets to enhance the functionality and integration of other applications. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything productive toward furthering my undertsanding of software development. Getting a good articulable understanding of Golang are what I'm focused on right now.
